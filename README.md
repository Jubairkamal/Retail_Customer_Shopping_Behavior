### Overview
   A complete end-to-end Data Analytics project analyzing customer purchasing patterns using Python, SQL, and Power BI. The analysis uncovers insights into revenue            behavior, customer loyalty, discount usage, product performance, and more.
  
  With advances in technology, online shopping has become a part of daily life and is expected to grow worldwide. Accordingly, customer behavior is becoming increasingly     complex over time. In a highly competitive retail environment, attracting new customers is significantly more expensive than retaining existing ones. To maximize profits   and provide better service, retailers analyze customer purchases to understand behavior patterns, improve retention, and optimize marketing and sales strategies.

### Problem Statement  <br> 
Customer buying habits are influenced by multiple factors: 
<br> • Discounts and promotions 
 <br> • Product reviews and ratings 
 <br> • Seasonal trends 
 <br> • Payment options 
 <br> Currently, the company does not have enough information to determine which factors most strongly influence customer purchases, making data-driven decision-making challenging.
