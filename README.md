## Overview

This end-to-end data analytics project analyzes customer purchasing patterns using **Python, SQL, and Power BI**. The analysis provides insights into revenue trends, customer loyalty, discount usage, product performance, and more.

With advances in technology, online shopping has become a part of daily life and is expected to grow worldwide. Accordingly, customer behavior is becoming increasingly complex over time. In a highly competitive retail environment, attracting new customers is significantly more expensive than retaining existing ones. To maximize profits and provide better service, retailers analyze customer purchases to understand behavior patterns, improve retention, and optimize marketing and sales strategies.
