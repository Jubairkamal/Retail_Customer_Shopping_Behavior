## Overview

This end-to-end data analytics project analyzes customer purchasing patterns using **Python, SQL, and Power BI**. The analysis provides insights into revenue trends, customer loyalty, discount usage, product performance, and more.

With online shopping becoming an integral part of daily life, customer behavior is growing increasingly complex. In a competitive retail environment, acquiring new customers is often more expensive than retaining existing ones. By analyzing customer purchases, retailers can understand behavior patterns, improve retention, and optimize marketing and sales strategies.
