Retail Customer Shopping Buying Analysis
Overview
A complete end-to-end Data Analytics project analyzing customer purchasing patterns using Python, SQL, and Power BI. The analysis uncovers insights into revenue behavior, customer loyalty, discount usage, product performance, and more.
With advances in technology, online shopping has become a part of daily life and is expected to grow worldwide. Accordingly, customer behavior is becoming increasingly complex over time. In a highly competitive retail environment, attracting new customers is significantly more expensive than retaining existing ones.
